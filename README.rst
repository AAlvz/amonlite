Amon - developer friendly system monitoring and logging tool
=============================================================

Introduction
=============

Amon tries to solve two very common problems for web application developers:


__1. System monitoring__


When we deploy our web applications it's important to know how much 
server resources they use over time, so that we can improve and optimize them.
On other hand installing a sophisticated server monitoring application looks
like overkill, if your app is not that big and probably lives on a single server.



__2. Language agnostic logging__
