Amon - developer friendly system monitoring and logging tool
=============================================================

Introduction
=============

Amon tries to solve two very common problems for web application developers:


**1. System monitoring**


When we deploy our web applications it's important to know how much 
server resources they use over time, so that we can improve and optimize them.
On other hand installing a sophisticated server monitoring application looks
like overkill, if your app is not that big and probably lives on a single server.



**2. Language agnostic logging**
